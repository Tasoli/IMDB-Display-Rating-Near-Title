IMDB Display Rating Near Title
===============

Chrome extension for displaying the rating of a project on IMDB to the left of its title.

Features:

* Displays rating for each movie in a filmography section of a person (actor/director/etc.)
* Distinguishes content based on rating and relevance*
* Generates a person rating based on its titles**

\* * TV items need a higher rating to be considered "good" (since they usually have higher ratings than movies to begin with). TV / Video Games >= 8, Film >= 7

\*** Only the first filmography section (IMDB sets most relevant as first) is used for calculating the person score.

Uses [The OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) for fetching the ratings data.
